## ðŸ”„ Data Pipeline

### 1. Data Source
- **Dataset**: Credit Card Default dataset downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
- **Format**: CSV file

### 2. Upload to PostgreSQL
- Used a Python script `upload.py` to upload the CSV into a PostgreSQL database.
- **Table Name**: `credit_card`

### 3. Data Cleaning
- A Jupyter Notebook was created to load the data from PostgreSQL.
- Performed necessary data cleaning and transformation.
- Cleaned data was saved:
  - Back into PostgreSQL in a new table named `credit_card_transformed`
  - Exported to a new CSV file `credit_card_transformed.csv` for optional use

### 4. Power BI Integration
- Power BI was connected to the PostgreSQL database.
- Imported the `credit_card_transformed` table.
- Created interactive visualizations and filters to analyze the data efficiently.
